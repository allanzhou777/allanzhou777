          <h2>My Journey</h2>
          <p>Hello, </p>
          <p>I'm a 17 year old student in Austin, Texas. I am passionate about technology, innovation, and creativity with a focus in machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Through my projects, from machine learning to web development, I have learned to improve my many of my soft and hard skills.</p>            
          <p>Outside of the workplace and classroom, I am involved in performing and visual arts. I've played cello since fifth grade, and have been an active member in my school's orchestra while organizing a few of my own events. These range from nursery-home performances to traditional street-performances. When I was a wee child, I also used to draw. Lots of my art was featured in my mentor's exhibitions, but this was an activity that I largely stopped... until recently. The past few years, I've picked up art, little by little, and have dabbled in everything from photography to graphic design to fine arts. </p>
          <p>Taking a step back, I first moved after 6th grade. It probably comes as no surprise, but many of my current (and former) friends got to know me through sports. In elementary school, I did 5 sports (swimming, track and field, soccer, basketball, and gymnastics), but I mainly focused on swimming (Go Makos!). Oftentimes, I'd spend entire weekends at meets, hanging out with teammates and coaches. I still keep in touch with many of my closest friends who have gone on to accomplish lots both in and outside swimming. </p>
          <p>In high school, I really explored various fields. Throughout my life, I've always been the quiet kid obsessed with math. However, it was during high school that I really grew, both in and outside of school. In school, I became involved with various clubs and extracurriculars. Despite joining the community as the quiet kid, I was soon elected to a few leadership positions where I would speak to hundreds of people at times. Outside of school, I started a cello quartet to play music in the streets and parks of Austin. Not only did I get to meet more people, but I was also able to perform for others. </p>
          <p>Besides all this, I am an avid music-listener and sporadic book-worm. I listen to all types of music, from hip hop to classical to rock. Some of my playlists can be found <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/fgk08h2yr6dc55n4b2ysl992d?si=21215b9bafb14bdf">here</a> . </p>
          <p>Moving forward, my main interests lie a combination of math and CS, specifically machine learning and artificial intelligence. I plan on pursuing these interests in college and throughout my career. </p>
          <br>
          <p>Sincerely,</p> 
          <p class="letter-signature">Allan Zhou</p>

      <h2 id="Sports">Sports!</h2>
      <p>As a kid, I did like, what, 6 sports? Hehe, well, life happens and now, I do zero sports. But maybe it was for the better.</p>
      <p>I also enjoy watching sports. I'm not a extreme supporter of anybody, nor do I follow a single sport too much. Still, I enjoy watching snowboarding, basketball, and swimming.</p>

      <p>I really like organizing things and helping others. Last summer, I co-led a summer program called <a href = "https://austinstrong.square.site/">[AustinStrong]</a> to help kids of Austin during the pandemic :) I've also organized a few street performances with my friends playing in parks, libraries, and even in front of grocery stores. </p>
